GX_TEVPREV		GX_CC_CPREV / GX_CC_APREV / GX_CA_APREV

always written as "tev", using lane selectors as appropriate.

tev.rgb = tev.rgb	-> GX_CC_CPREV
tev.rgb = tev.a		-> GX_CC_APREV
tev.rgb = tev.aaa	-> GX_CC_APREV

tev.a = tev.a		-> GX_CA_APREV

GX_TEVREG{0,1,2}	GX_CC_C{0,1,2} / GX_CC_A{0,1,2} / GX_CA_A{0,1,2}

always written as "cr0", "cr1", "cr2", with lane selectors as appropriate.

Colour channels
---------------

colour0/colour0a0/alpha0 are written as "chan0", with swizzles.
colour1/colour1a1/alpha1 are written as "chan1", with swizzles.

Swizzles
--------

For colour channels:

texmapN[texcoordM].rgb must use texc with [RGBX] swap table.
texmapN[texcoordM].aaa can use texa with [XXXA] swap table or texc with [AAAX] swap table.

We can refer to texmapN[texcoordM].rrr as texa with [XXXR]. Colour channel could then be e.g. texmapN[texcoordM].agb using texc with [AGBX].

For alpha channel:

texmapN[texcoordM].r must use texa with [XXXR] swap table (similar for G, B).
texmapN[texcoordM].a must use texa with [XXXA] swap table.
